# Design-and-Simulation-of-8-8-Synchronous-RAM
This project implements an 8×8 Synchronous Random Access Memory (RAM) using Verilog HDL. The RAM has 8 memory locations (3‑bit address) and each location stores 8‑bit data. All read and write operations are performed synchronously on the rising edge of the clock.
